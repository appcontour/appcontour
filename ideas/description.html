<CENTER>by <BR>Maria Andreeva, Ivan Dynnikov, Sergey Koval, Konrad 
Polthier, Iskander Taimanov</CENTER>
<P>Here we offer a set of tools for manipulating knots and links in the 
three-space by using the three-page presentation of links, which was proposed 
and developed by I. Dynnikov in [<a href="#1">1</a>][<a href="#2">2</a>][<a 
href="#3">3</a>].<P>The approach is based on a simple and 
very well known observation that every link in the three-space is topologically 
equivalent to a link that lies entirely in a three-page book, i.e. the union of 
three half-planes with common boundary. Though being not convenient for human 
perception, this way of presenting links seems to be very efficient for handling 
knots by computer. It provides a very quick way from a combinatorial description 
of a link to its three-dimensional presentation. A three-page link admits a lot 
of transformations that preserve its isotopy class and can be easily found. This 
fact is used in the knot simplifying tool included herein.<P>This software for 
knot manipulation and simplification builds on the JavaView library [<a 
href="#5">5</a>].<H3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000080">Currently available ...<!--mstheme--></font></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To download a knot from the server click "Choose knot" button. At 
  the present time, we have a collection of knots presented in <A 
  href="#jkb">.jkb</A> format, as <A 
  href="#3D">3D curve</A> (.txt 
  files), and as a <A href="#gc">Gauss 
  code</A> (.gc files).<p>Files 31.jkb, 141.jkb, 322.jkb, and 539&nbsp; have been 
  generated automatically from hand-made (ID) planar diagrams of unknots having 
  31, 141, 322, and 539 crossings respectively. These unknots were used to test 
  the simplifier. The unknot with 31 crossings is shown below. </p>
  <P><IMG 
  src="figures/unknot31.gif" width="400" height="300"> <br>
	The unknot with 539 crossings is a satellite of this unknot (see [1] for a 
  picture). 
  <P>The source of the knots in TXT format is the Knot-Plot web site created by 
	Robert Scharein [<a href="#4">4</a>] which contains a collection of knots 
	and links with small crossing number (less than or equal to 10). The 
  files with .gc extension contain <A 
  href="#gc">Gauss codes</A> of the 
  same links. These codes were generated automatically (SK) from the .txt files.<P>For converting a planar diagram to a three-page diagram the algorithm 
  described in [<a href="#1">1</a>] is used.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000080">Input a knot<A name=inputknot></A><!--mstheme--></font></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To input your own knot click "Input knot" button and choose a 
  method of input. Now available methods are by using <A 
  href="#3D">3D curve</A> or the <A 
  href="#gc">Gauss code</A>. If you 
  are already using some other knot presentation with another software, you are 
  welcome to let us know the specification of the format you are using by 
  sending e-mail at dynnikov@mech.math.msu.su. Then, we may make it possible to 
  input a knot in your favorite format.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000080">Simplify a knot<A name=simplify></A><!--mstheme--></font></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you press the "Simplify" button, the knot simplifier starts. It 
  implements an algorithm described in [1]. We shall explain very shortly the 
  idea of the algorithm. 
  <P>In the case of the three-page presentation of knots, a natural measure of 
  complexity is the number of intersection points of the knot with the binding 
  line of the three-page book. The simplifier performs operations on the knot 
  that preserve the isotopy class of the knot and tries to make the complexity 
  as less as possible. Let us consider how this works. Look at the following 
  three-page knot, which is the trefoil knot in fact. 
  <P><IMG 
  src="figures/trefoil1.gif" width="400" height="300"> 
  <P>Its complexity equals 9. What if we replace the part of the knot marked in 
  red with the curve marked in blue in the figure below? 
  <P><IMG 
  src="figures/trefoil2.gif" width="400" height="300"> 
  <BR>We obtain a topologically equivalent knot of the same complexity, but now 
  we obviously can simplify it by contracting the arc connecting the two 
  rightmost points: 
  <P><IMG 
  src="figures/trefoil3.gif" width="400" height="300"> 
  <BR>After doing that, we obtain a three-page knot of complexity 8. 
  <P><IMG 
  src="figures/trefoil4.gif" width="400" height="300"> 
  <P>The knot simplifier just tries to simplify a given knot by transformations 
  of this kind. If sufficiently many subsequent trials are not successful, i.e. 
  the knot is not simplified for a long time, the simplifier stops. More details 
  about the transformations used in the simplifier see [1]. 
  <P>At the present state, the simplifier does not search among all three-page 
  diagrams that can be obtain from the current one by available transforms and 
  does not make a "canonical" choice. So, if you click the "Simplify" button 
  again, the picture may change.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000080">Edit a knot<A name=edit></A><!--mstheme--></font></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The only available editing tool for now is cyclic permutation of 
  vertices on the binding line, which is achieved by pressing the "Vertex 
  permutation" button. Other editing tools coming soon.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000080">Input a knot as a 3D curve<A name=3D></A><!--mstheme--></font></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To input a knot presented by a 3D polygon just type coordinates of 
  all vertices in the order they follow on the knot. Coordinates must be 
  separated by blank spaces or new lines. <BR>For example the trefoil knot is 
  presented by a polygon with vertices (0,0,0), (3,0,1), (0,2,0), (1,0,1), 
  (0,4,0), (4,0,1), (0,1,0), (2,0,1), (0,3,0), (0,0,1). To input it, type <BR>0 
  0 0 3 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 4 0 4 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 1 <BR>and click "ok" 
  button. The Gauss code of the knot appears. Click "ok" button again to see the 
  three-page picture of the knot. 
  <P>If your link consists of more than one connected component, separate 
  records for different components by a blank line. 
  <P>Warning: at the present state, for converting a 3D polygon to a planar 
  diagram of a knot, projection along the z-axis is used. If the projection of 
  your knot along the z-axis is not generic (i.e. two vertices are projected to 
  the same point, a vertex is projected to an internal point of an edge, or a 
  triple crossing occurs), then the conversion may fail. 
<BR>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000080">Input the Gauss code of a knot<A name=gc></A><!--mstheme--></font></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you have planar diagram of a knot or link you may input it by 
  typing its Gauss code. The diagram must be connected and have at least one 
  crossing. We use an encoding a little different from what is usually called 
  Gauss code, providing additional information that allows to distinguish knots 
  from their mirror images. To input the link do the following. 
  <P>For each component, choose an orientation and a starting point. 
  <P>Assign different indices, which must be natural numbers, to all the 
  crossings. 
  <P>For each connected component, go along it starting from the marked point in 
  the chosen direction, and each time you come through a crossing, write down 
  the index of the crossing preceded by two symbols: the first one must be + or 
  - indicating whether you go over or under the crossing, and the second must 
  be&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; or&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; sign indicating whether you see the 
  arc that you intersect going from left two the right or from right to the 
  left, respectively. Entries for different crossings must be separated by 
  spaces. 
  <P>When you come back to the starting point of the chosen component, proceed 
  with the next one. Separate entries for different components by keyword 
  "component". 
  <P>For example, for the diagram below <BR><IMG 
  src="figures/Fig8.gif" width="400" height="231"> <BR>you 
  get the following Gauss code: <BR>-&gt;5 +&lt;6&nbsp; component&nbsp; +&lt;5 
  -&gt;6 -&gt;4 +&lt;3 -&lt;1 +&gt;2 -&gt;3 +&lt;4 -&lt;2 +&gt;1 
  <P>This way of inputting links seems to take much time. We are now working on 
  a better format for input.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to make the package more convenient for those who want to 
  use it in their own research&nbsp; we are going to provide converters to and 
  from all popular formats for presenting knots. In particular, it will be 
  possible to input a knot as a closure of a braid or a tangle word. If you are
