There are 2 executables in this directory.

visible:

Takes in input the morse description of a *visible* contour
(see some examples in directory examples) and computes a morse
description of a reconstructed apparent contour.

This morse description however contain 'cusps' as events, and
is not accepted by showcontour (at the moment).
Program "contour" was recently updated in order to accept this
kind of description.

morse2morse:

converts the morse description with 'cusps' as events into the
morse description used by 'contour' and understandable by showcontour.

Example:


./visible examples/torus_vis.morse | ./morse2morse | showcontour

alternatively:

./visible examples/torus_vis.morse | contour printmorse | showcontour

The results differ (not in the topology!) because contour transforms the
incoming morse description into a "region description", thus losing spatial
information.
