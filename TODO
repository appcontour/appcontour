compute gcd and spread with long long int (as in groebner.c)

Example of a complex alexander ideal for genus2 surfaces:
echo "knotname{16a_1}" | ./contour punchhole -r 45 -s 1 | ./contour --out alexander

spread between two monomials does not work (laurent.c)
Update: try to use the new groebner algorithm

laurent_try_reduce_pair should also try to reduce the coefficients of the
bigger polynomial
Restate in view of the new groebner algorithm


1. Add the possibility to personalize default values (e.g. --autosurgery)
using environment variables or via rc file.

2. Add "--autosurgery" option to authomatically apply surgeries that do not change
the fundamental group but increases the deficiency of the initial presentation
(DONE?!?)

3. Improve graphic presentation of Hacon graph
