2011-03-25: Computation of the fundamental group of the surface,
	the internal solid set and the external set.
	This is obtained with the new commands:
	"fundamental" "insidefundamental" "outsidefundamental".
	Example:
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	$ ./contour insidefundamental examples/painted_klein_bottle.morse 
	Finitely presented group with 3 generators
	<a,b,c; aCAcBCb>
	-----------------------------------------------------------------

2011-03-20: Implemented computation of a cell complex corresponding
	to the surface, or to the internal solid set, or to the
	external set.  Commands:
	"cellcomplex" "insidecomplex" "outsidecomplex"

2010-09-25: new actions:
        "ccorientation <ccid>" computes the orientation of a single
        component <ccid>.  E.g. for a hollow sphere one of the two
	spheres is positively oriented, the other is negatively oriented.
        "ccparent <ccid>" displays which connected component directly
        contains component <ccid>, "None" if <ccid> is an external
	component.
	"ccordering" prints the complete partial containment ordering
	scheme among the 3D connected components.  E.g. a result like
	{4 6{5{1} 2 3}} means that components 4 and 6 are external;
	5, 2 and 3 are directly contained in component 6; component
	1 is directly contained in component 5.

2010-08-28: contour now accepts a morse description in which cusps are
	given as morse events, rather than arc properties.  This is
	motivated by the output of the program "visible" that computes
	a contour with a given visible part.

2009-03-16: fixed allocation problem in canonifyarc 
	an S1 without cusps has dvalues=1 but should not be canonify

2008-11-24: fixed gluearcs/pinchneck for contours without huffman
	labelling.

2008-11-20: new names for simple rules (and their inverse) is now
	the default.  The environment variable "APPCONTOUR_OLDNAMES"
	can be set to a nonempty value to force use of old names
	(or use the option --oldnames).  Here is the correspondence:
	K0    = N4  (tangency)
	K1    = N2
	K1B   = N3
	K2    = N1
	T     = N5  (triple point)
	L     = C1  (lip)
	B     = C2  (beak-to-beak)
	S     = CN1 (swallowtail)
	C     = CN3 (cusp-crossing)

	TI    = T1  (transfer-island)
	CR0L  = CN2L
	CR0R  = CN2R
	CR0LB = CN2LB
	CR0RB = CN2RB

2008-11-16: added cut&paste: add sphere (add a positive S1)
	punch hole (add a negative S1), commands are respectively
	"addsphere" and "punchhole" (option -r x:y must be used
	to indicate region and dvalue.
	Added "removehole", which is the reverse of punchhole.
	Action "listholes" lists all region that are the inside
	of some hole.

2008-11-14: fixed a couple of bugs.

2008-11-12: rule invcn1 (creation of a swallowtail) and rule
	invcn3 (puncture).
	command "listinvcn1" ("listswallatails") or command
	"listinvcn3" ("listpunctures") show all applicable
	instances.  Rules can be applied with commands
	"swallowtail" or "puncture" and passing arc (arcs)
	information with option -a.
	Alternatively "rule invcn1:n" or "rule invcn3:n" applies
	the n-th instance.
	Also "rule invcn1b:n" is implemented which implements the
	specular version of invcn1.

2008-11-12: rule invc1 (creation of a wrinkle) is now implemented.
	command "listwr" show all applicable instances,
	command "-r r:s wrinkle" wrinkles stratum s of region r
	command "rule invc1:n" applies the n-th instance of
	rule invc1 (wrinkle).
	contour_interact.sh is also updated.

2008-11-08: the first set of inverse rules is now implemented.
	command "mergearcs" lists all applicable rules inverse
	of N1, N2, N3, N4, C2 (they are all a kind of merge of
	two arcs of the boundary of some region.
	command "rule" (which is now an abbreviation of "applyrule")
	can be used to apply such rules.
	Command "mergearcs" can also be used, by specifying the
	region (option -r) and the two arcs (option -a, twice)
	where the rule should be applied.

2007-07-04: the computation of the mendes graph is now finally working.
	The name of the graph was changed from "hacon" to "mendes"
	as for suggestion of the authors.
	(see NEWS file for command-line description).
	We still need to improve the graphical presentation
	in formats like "kig" or "xfig".

2007-06-15: now contour can directly operate on "knot" descriptions
	(it was only possible to convert knot to morse).  This
	is done by forking contour and using a pipe.  This only
	works on a unix environment.

2007-06-13: showcontour can now deal with most of the new
	extensions for the morse description, specifically, inheritance
	of orientation across arcs and recognition of the X' and X`
	variants for bridged crossings.

2007-06-06: added folder "gtkcontour" (Pasquarelli) holding the
	project for a graphical frontend to contour.

2007-05-07: commands "iscontour" and "ishuffman" check a given
	morse (or region) description for consistency as an
	apparent contour without/with huffman labelling.

2007-04-25: allowing inheritance of arc orientation across nodes (in
	morse definition).

2007-03-02: fixed wrong computation of ohmoto invariant, 3D connected
	components and euler characteristic when f is not zero at
	infinity.  This can be forced by using option "--fi".
	In this case the surface is thought as projected onto an
	S^2 (compactified R^2 with the addition of the point at
	infinity).

2007-02-28: counting number of link components in the apparent contour
	(displayed with the "info" command).

2007-02-20: see NEW for a list of changes related to the Oberwolfach workshop.

2006-10-27: bump version to 0.8, preparing for a distribution.

2006-10-23: nuovo programma per la visualizzazione grafica di un
	contorno apparente.
	Utilizzabile anche da "utils/contour_interact.sh"

2006-10-05: la regora N6 e' ora diventata CR2 (come nel paper)

2006-10-03: finalmente e' possibile costruire una descrizione di morse
	a partire da una region description

2006-09-26: possibilita' di specificazione nomefile come secondo argomento.
	Nuove rule A1 e A2 (rimuovi regione ad anello).
	Nuove rule N6, CN1, CN2L, CN2R, CN2LB, CN2RB, CN3

	Nuova funzione "knot2morse"; con alcuni esempi in 'examples'

2006-09-21: errore nel controllo dei valori di d in un
	nodo.  I 4 valori sono controllati correttamente,
	ma l'arco in cui d salta di due ha una direzione
	di crescita di d che non veniva controllato.

	Completata la rule n1 e aggiunte le regole n2, n3, n4,
	che possono essere chiamate anche come (ad es)
	n1:3 per indicare l'applicazione della regola 1 solo
	al terzo match.

	Nuova funzione testallrules

	Nuova funzione countcc (vedi NEWS), lettura formato 'sketch'

	Nuova rule N5
	Nuove rule C1 e C2
